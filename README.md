## Welcome to TDD for JavaScript!

We'll be building a program to display and manipulate quotes.

# Here you'll find
* skeleton code for the program
* initial test structure
* the testing framework we'll be using, Jasmine

# To start with, the most important files are:
* src/Quote.js
* spec/QuoteSpec.js
